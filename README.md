# prime-factorization

This repository includes the most efficient classical algorithms that I can come up with to factorize integers. I'm open to public suggestions on possibly better methods.
I'll also be trying out [Pollard's Rho technique](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pollards-rho-algorithm-prime-factorization/) and also the [General number field sieve method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_number_field_sieve).

This is to help (me) understand the classical limit imposed by this problem in anticipation of learning about [Shor's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm).
